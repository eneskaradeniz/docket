// The capability registry: the single data file every support-level, route and model question is
// answered from. A gate carries evidence only where a test of that exact title exists in this
// repository — an absent gate is honesty, not an oversight. Without a recorded operator-gate run
// no provider can read as `full`; without usage visibility (G4) none can read as `isolated`, so
// today only the sdk provider tops out at `isolated` and the rest stay `experimental`. Model data
// (models, effort levels, prices) lands with the model-catalog issues; the route kinds start empty.
